<!--
- Allow permissioned users to assign reviewers to cards via the frontend: currently this is handled with scripts so there are very few people who can do this task
- improved activity log: When users view their boards then the activity log should be in their face by default. Display:
- reviews done
- if anyone agreed or disagreed with a review that the user gave
- pull requests created, merged, reviewed, etc
- cards started, finished, reviews requested
